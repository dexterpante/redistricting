        "#### Instructions\n",
        "1.  **Distance to Municipality/Poblacion:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` is used to retrieve the administrative boundary of the municipality. The query string is formed by combining the `municipality_name` with ', Philippines'. The centroid of this retrieved boundary (`gdf_municipality.geometry.union_all().centroid`) is calculated to represent the central point of the municipality. `geopy.distance.geodesic` is then used to calculate the geodesic distance in kilometers between the school's coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) and the municipality's centroid (`municipality_centroid.y`, `municipality_centroid.x`). The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` returns an empty GeoDataFrame (meaning the municipality could not be geocoded) or any exception occurs during geocoding or centroid calculation, the `distance_to_municipality_km` is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "2.  **Distance to Major Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` is employed to retrieve a road network within a `dist_search_buffer` of 10 km (the `radius_km`) around the school's location. A `custom_filter` is applied to specifically target major paved roads: `[highway~\"primary|secondary|trunk|motorway\"][surface~\"paved\"]`. If a road network (`G`) is successfully retrieved and contains edges, the graph is converted into GeoDataFrames for nodes and edges using `ox.utils_graph.graph_to_gdfs()`. The geodesic distance from the `school_point` to each `LineString` segment of the identified roads is approximated by calculating the distance to its start and end points using `geopy.distance.geodesic`. The minimum of these distances across all road segments is taken as the approximate distance to the nearest major paved road. The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` fails to find a road network within the search buffer, or if the retrieved network `G` contains no edges (`G.edges` is empty), or if `gdf_edges` is empty, or if any exception occurs during the process, the `distance_to_major_paved_road_km` is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "3.  **Distance to Minor Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** The methodology for calculating the distance to minor paved roads is identical to that used for major paved roads. The key difference lies in the `custom_filter` applied to `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()`, which targets minor paved roads: `[highway~\"tertiary|residential|unclassified|service|living_street\"][surface~\"paved\"]`.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** The criteria for setting `distance_to_minor_paved_road_km` to `np.nan` are the same as for major paved roads: if no road network is found, or if the network contains no edges, or if `gdf_edges` is empty, or if an exception occurs.\n"

Authentication was successfully achieved using `google.colab.auth.authenticate_user()` to obtain user credentials, which were then used to initialize `gspread.Client`. The \"Full\\_STRIDE\\_Database\" Google Sheet was successfully opened and loaded into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "*   **Column Header Correction**: An initial data loading error where the second row was incorrectly treated as headers was identified. This was corrected by reloading the DataFrame using `get_as_dataframe(worksheet, header=0)`, ensuring the first row served as the correct column headers.\n",
        "*   **Column Selection and Renaming**: Eleven specific columns ('school name', 'school id', 'address', 'barangay', 'municipality', 'district', 'legislative district', 'division', 'region', 'latitude', 'longitude') were identified. Source column names like 'School.Name' and 'Street.Address' were successfully mapped and renamed to the desired standardized names. A new DataFrame, `location_df`, was created containing only these selected and renamed columns.\n",
        "*   **Saving to New Google Sheet**: A new Google Sheet named 'school\\_location' was successfully created in Google Drive. Attempts to explicitly include headers using arguments like `include_header`, `row_as_header`, or `col_names` in `gspread_dataframe.set_with_dataframe` resulted in `TypeError`. It was found that `set_with_dataframe` includes DataFrame headers by default, and the `location_df` was successfully written to the new sheet.\n",

        "*   The established process for authenticating `gspread` in Colab using `google.colab.auth.authenticate_user()` should be documented for future projects to avoid re-encountering common authentication errors.\n",
        "*   For future `gspread_dataframe` operations, remember that `set_with_dataframe` automatically includes headers, and attempting to pass header-related arguments can lead to errors.\n"

        "The previous code failed due to several issues: the `osmnx.features.features_from_point` function used an incorrect argument name (`point` instead of `center_point`), `osmnx.distance.great_circle_vec` was not found (indicating a version incompatibility or removal), and a `DeprecationWarning` was issued for `unary_union`. I will fix these by: 1) correcting the argument name to `center_point` for `features_from_point`, 2) replacing `ox.distance.great_circle_vec` with `geopy.distance.geodesic` for accurate distance calculations, 3) updating `unary_union` to `union_all()` as per the deprecation warning, and 4) adding error handling for the `get_nearest_road_distance` function when a road network cannot be found to avoid potential `KeyError` or `IndexError` when accessing `G.edges` or `nearest_edge` results.\n",

        "#### Instructions\n",
        "1.  **Document Feature Identification (Yes/No and Confidence):**\n",
        "    *   **Geographical Scope:** All feature queries use `osmnx.features.features_from_point` with `center_point=(latitude, longitude)` and `dist=10` km. This means a feature is considered 'present' if any part of it is found within a 10 km radius of the school's coordinates.\n",
        "    *   **OpenStreetMap Tags:**\n",
        "        *   **Mountains:** `{'natural': 'mountain'}`\n",
        "        *   **Volcanoes:** `{'natural': 'volcano'}`\n",
        "        *   **Hills:** `{'natural': 'hill'}`\n",
        "        *   **Forests:** `[{'landuse': 'forest'}, {'natural': 'wood'}]` (either tag indicates a forest)\n",
        "        *   **Rivers:** `{'waterway': 'river'}`\n",
        "        *   **Coastlines:** `{'natural': 'coastline'}`\n",
        "    *   **'Yes'/'No' Criteria:** 'Yes' is returned if `gdf_features` (the GeoDataFrame resulting from the `osmnx` query) is not empty. 'No' is returned if `gdf_features` is empty.\n",
        "    *   **Confidence Levels:**\n",
        "        *   'High': Assigned when a feature is detected ('Yes'). This implies direct detection via OSM data within the specified radius.\n",
        "        *   'N/A': Assigned when a feature is not detected ('No').\n",
        "        *   'Error: {e}': Assigned if an exception occurs during the feature query (e.g., network error, `osmnx` error). This indicates the query could not be completed successfully for that feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Document Distance to Municipality/Poblacion:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:**\n",
        "        *   **Geocoding:** The `municipality_name` (e.g., 'LIBON') is combined with ', Philippines' to form a query string (e.g., 'LIBON, Philippines'). `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` is used to retrieve the administrative boundary of the municipality.\n",
        "        *   **Centroid Calculation:** If a boundary is successfully retrieved, the centroid of the municipality's geometry (`gdf_municipality.geometry.union_all().centroid`) is calculated to represent its central point.\n",
        "        *   **Distance Calculation:** The geodesic distance (in kilometers) between the school's coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) and the municipality's centroid (`municipality_centroid.y`, `municipality_centroid.x`) is calculated using `geopy.distance.geodesic`. The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` returns an empty GeoDataFrame or any exception occurs during geocoding or centroid calculation, the distance is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Document Distance to Major Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:**\n",
        "        *   **Road Network Query:** `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` is used to retrieve a road network within a `dist_search_buffer` (10 km) around the school's location. The `custom_filter` parameter is applied to include only major paved roads, specifically `[highway~\"primary|secondary|trunk|motorway\"][surface~\"paved\"]`.\n",
        "        *   **Nearest Road Segment:** If a road network (`G`) is successfully retrieved and contains edges, the distance from the `school_point` (Shapely Point object) to the nearest road segment in the `gdf_edges` GeoDataFrame is calculated. This is achieved by iterating through all road geometries in `gdf_edges` and finding the minimum Euclidean distance, then approximating conversion to kilometers by multiplying by 111.32 (approximate degrees to km conversion at the equator, for small distances).\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If no road network is found, or if `G.edges` is empty, or if an exception occurs, the distance is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Document Distance to Minor Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** The methodology is identical to the major paved road calculation, but with a different `custom_filter` for the road network query:\n",
        "        *   **Road Network Query:** `[highway~\"tertiary|residential|unclassified|service|living_street\"][surface~\"paved\"]`.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** Same as for major paved roads."

        "I've noticed that the application of the `get_geospatial_info` function was interrupted, and the sample results contain errors related to how feature tags are processed by `osmnx.features.features_from_point` and an approximate calculation for road distances. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the geospatial data, I need to refine the `get_geospatial_info` function before proceeding.\n",
        "\n",
        "My plan is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Refine `get_geospatial_info` function**:\n",
        "    *   **Correct Multi-Tag Feature Handling**: Modify the function to correctly process features defined by multiple tags (e.g., forests). Instead of passing a list of tag dictionaries directly, I will iterate through each tag dictionary and combine the results from separate `osmnx.features.features_from_point` calls. This will resolve the \"Error: `tags` must be a dict with values of bool, str, or list of str.\"\n",
        "    *   **Implement Geodesic Road Distance**: Replace the approximate Euclidean distance calculation for major and minor paved roads with `geopy.distance.geodesic` for more accurate geodesic distance measurements, aligning with the requirement for precise distance calculations.\n",
        "    *   **Enhance Road Network Error Handling**: Improve the robustness of the `get_nearest_road_distance` helper function to better handle cases where `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point` might not return a graph or valid edges, ensuring `np.nan` is returned gracefully.\n",
        "*   **Re-apply Function to Sampled Data**: Re-run the corrected `get_geospatial_info` function on the `sampled_location_df` to populate the geospatial columns with accurate data.\n",
        "*   **Document Methodology and Confidence Logic**: Provide detailed documentation explaining the precise methodology for identifying each geographical feature and calculating each distance. This will include the specific OpenStreetMap tags and query parameters used for each feature type, the criteria for 'Yes'/'No' answers (e.g., presence within 10 km, type of OSM object), the methods for defining 'poblacion'/'municipality', and the criteria for confidence levels (e.g., density of features, reliability/completeness of OSM data, exactness of match, proximity).\n",
        "*   **Review Sample Results and Scale Up (Conditional)**: Examine the results from the 10-observation sample, including the new columns for features, confidence, and distances. Based on this review, assess the function's performance and accuracy. If satisfactory, discuss the strategy for applying the function to the full `location_df` and consider potential optimizations for performance, given the large number of rows.\n",
        "*   **Final Task**: Display the updated sampled `location_df` showing all new geographical feature and distance columns, along with their 'Yes'/'No' responses, confidence levels, and distances. Provide a comprehensive summary of the findings and confirm that the documentation on methodology and confidence logic is transparently included."

I need to fix this syntax error in the `feature_tags` dictionary by properly closing the list for 'forest' and ensuring correct comma separation for the next item. After correcting the syntax, I will redefine the function and then re-apply it to the `sampled_location_df`.\n",

        "*   **Document Methodology and Confidence Logic**: Provide detailed documentation explaining the precise methodology for identifying each geographical feature and calculating each distance. This will include the specific OpenStreetMap tags and query parameters used for each feature type, the criteria for 'Yes'/'No' answers (e.g., presence within 10 km, type of OSM object), the methods for defining 'poblacion'/'municipality', and the criteria for confidence levels (e.g., density of features, reliability/completeness of OSM data, exactness of match, proximity).\n",
        "*   **Review Sample Results and Scale Up (Conditional)**: Examine the results from the 10-observation sample, including the new columns for features, confidence, and distances. Based on this review, assess the function's performance and accuracy. If satisfactory, discuss the strategy for applying the function to the full `location_df` and consider potential optimizations for performance, given the large number of rows.\n",

The query string is formed by combining the `municipality_name` with ', Philippines'. The centroid of this retrieved boundary (`gdf_municipality.geometry.union_all().centroid`) is calculated to represent the central point of the municipality. `geopy.distance.geodesic` is then used to calculate the geodesic distance in kilometers between the school's coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) and the municipality's centroid (`municipality_centroid.y`, `municipality_centroid.x`). The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` returns an empty GeoDataFrame (meaning the municipality could not be geocoded) or any exception occurs during geocoding or centroid calculation, the `distance_to_municipality_km` is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "2.  **Distance to Major Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` is employed to retrieve a road network within a `dist_search_buffer` of 10 km (the `radius_km`) around the school's location. A `custom_filter` is applied to specifically target major paved roads: `[highway~\"primary|secondary|trunk|motorway\"][surface~\"paved\"]`. If a road network (`G`) is successfully retrieved and contains edges, the graph is converted into GeoDataFrames for nodes and edges using `ox.utils_graph.graph_to_gdfs()`. The geodesic distance from the `school_point` to each `LineString` segment of the identified roads is approximated by calculating the distance to its start and end points using `geopy.distance.geodesic`. The minimum of these distances across all road segments is taken as the approximate distance to the nearest major paved road. The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` fails to find a road network within the search buffer, or if the retrieved network `G` contains no edges (`G.edges` is empty), or if `gdf_edges` is empty, or if any exception occurs during the process, the `distance_to_major_paved_road_km` is set to `np.nan`.\n",

        "    *   **Methodology:** The methodology for calculating the distance to minor paved roads is identical to that used for major paved roads. The key difference lies in the `custom_filter` applied to `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()`, which targets minor paved roads: `[highway~\"tertiary|residential|unclassified|service|living_street\"][surface~\"paved\"]`.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** The criteria for setting `distance_to_minor_paved_road_km` to `np.nan` are the same as for major paved roads: if no road network is found, or if the network contains no edges, or if `gdf_edges` is empty, or if an exception occurs."

This will explicitly state that geodesic distance is used for the municipality centroid, and an approximation of geodesic distance (to segment endpoints) is used for road segments. It will also outline the specific OpenStreetMap tags and query parameters used for roads and the search radius.\n",

        "#### Instructions\n",
        "1.  **Distance to Municipality/Poblacion:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` is used to retrieve the administrative boundary of the municipality. The query string is formed by combining the `municipality_name` with ', Philippines'. The centroid of this retrieved boundary (`gdf_municipality.geometry.union_all().centroid`) is calculated to represent the central point of the municipality. `geopy.distance.geodesic` is then used to calculate the geodesic distance in kilometers between the school's coordinates (`lat`, `lon`) and the municipality's centroid (`municipality_centroid.y`, `municipality_centroid.x`). The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` returns an empty GeoDataFrame (meaning the municipality could not be geocoded) or any exception occurs during geocoding or centroid calculation, the `distance_to_municipality_km` is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "2.  **Distance to Major Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` is employed to retrieve a road network within a `dist_search_buffer` of 10 km (the `radius_km`) around the school's location. A `custom_filter` is applied to specifically target major paved roads: `[highway~\"primary|secondary|trunk|motorway\"][surface~\"paved\"]`. If a road network (`G`) is successfully retrieved and contains edges, the graph is converted into GeoDataFrames for nodes and edges using `ox.utils_graph.graph_to_gdfs()`. The geodesic distance from the `school_point` to each `LineString` segment of the identified roads is approximated by calculating the distance to its start and end points using `geopy.distance.geodesic`. The minimum of these distances across all road segments is taken as the approximate distance to the nearest major paved road. The result is rounded to two decimal places.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** If `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` fails to find a road network within the search buffer, or if the retrieved network `G` contains no edges (`G.edges` is empty), or if `gdf_edges` is empty, or if any exception occurs during the process, the `distance_to_major_paved_road_km` is set to `np.nan`.\n",
        "3.  **Distance to Minor Paved Road:**\n",
        "    *   **Methodology:** The methodology for calculating the distance to minor paved roads is identical to that used for major paved roads. The key difference lies in the `custom_filter` applied to `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()`, which targets minor paved roads: `[highway~\"tertiary|residential|unclassified|service|living_street\"][surface~\"paved\"]`.\n",
        "    *   **'N/A' Criteria:** The criteria for setting `distance_to_minor_paved_road_km` to `np.nan` are the same as for major paved roads: if no road network is found, or if the network contains no edges, or if `gdf_edges` is empty, or if an exception occurs."

        "Applying the `get_geospatial_info` function to the full `location_df` (which has over 45,000 rows) as a direct row-wise iteration (using `iterrows()`) will be **extremely time-consuming and inefficient**, given the network requests to OpenStreetMap for each row. The current sample of 10 rows already shows that each query takes a significant amount of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "To scale this operation to the full dataset, the following optimizations and strategies should be considered:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Batch Processing/Vectorization (Limited):** While `osmnx` functions are generally designed for single-point or single-polygon queries, some steps can be optimized. For instance, geocoding municipalities could potentially be batched if there are many schools within the same municipality. However, road network queries are inherently point-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Caching:** Implement robust caching for `osmnx` queries. `osmnx` has built-in caching, but ensuring it's properly configured and used effectively can significantly reduce redundant API calls if multiple schools are in proximity or query the same areas. For example, if multiple schools are in 'LIBON', the geocoding query for 'LIBON' should only be executed once.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Parallel Processing/Asynchronous Requests:** For network-bound operations like querying OSM, parallel processing (e.g., using Python's `multiprocessing` module or `concurrent.futures`) or asynchronous requests (`asyncio` if the underlying libraries support it) could be used to make multiple API calls concurrently. This would be the most impactful optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Reduce Query Scope/Simplify Logic (for road distances):**\n",
        "    *   **Road Network Queries**: Instead of calling `ox.graph.graph_from_point` for every single school, it might be more efficient to query larger geographical areas (e.g., a division or region) for road networks and then perform the nearest-segment calculations locally within that pre-downloaded network. This would reduce the number of API calls significantly.\n",
        "    *   **Simplify Nearest Road Calculation**: The current method of iterating through `gdf_edges` and approximating distance to start/end points is computationally intensive. `geopandas` and `shapely` offer more efficient spatial indexing (e.g., R-trees) and methods (`distance` for GeoSeries/GeoDataFrames) for finding the nearest geometry, which could be leveraged if road networks are loaded locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Pre-computation for Municipalities:** For the `distance_to_municipality_km`, if the list of unique municipalities is manageable, their centroids could be pre-geocoded and stored in a lookup table. Then, for each school, simply retrieve the pre-computed centroid and calculate the distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Error Handling and Rate Limits:** Continue to implement robust error handling (as done in the function) and ensure compliance with OSM Overpass API rate limits (e.g., by adding delays between requests if not using caching effectively or if making many queries). The `NaN` values currently reflect queries that failed, and understanding the root cause (e.g., true absence of data vs. API limits) is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "The current `get_geospatial_info` function is suitable for small samples, but direct application to the full `location_df` will be prohibitively slow. Significant refactoring for parallel processing, caching, and potentially local spatial indexing (after bulk data downloads) would be necessary to handle the large dataset efficiently. The high rate of `NaN`s in road distances also suggests that the current road query logic or OSM data coverage might be insufficient for certain areas within the specified `radius_km`."

        "\n",
        "This notebook aimed to extract school location data from a Google Sheet, process it, and then enrich it with geospatial information, specifically focusing on distances to municipality centers and paved roads. The following steps were successfully completed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Loading and Preparation**: The `Full_STRIDE_Database.gsheet` was successfully loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Initial authentication issues with `gspread` were resolved by using `google.colab.auth.authenticate_user()` and `gspread.Client(creds)`. Column headers were corrected, and a `location_df` was created with the required columns (`school name`, `school id`, `address`, `barangay`, `municipality`, `district`, `legislative district`, `division`, `region`, `latitude`, `longitude`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Sample Data Creation**: A `sampled_location_df` of 10 observations was created for efficient testing of geospatial functions, ensuring reproducibility with `random_state=42`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Geospatial Function Development (`get_geospatial_info`)**: A function was developed to calculate geospatial distances. This function was refined through several iterations:\n",
        "    *   Initial attempts included geographical feature detection (mountains, rivers, etc.), but this was later removed to focus solely on distance calculations, as per the updated task. This was due to `osmnx` API limitations and error handling complexity for diverse feature types.\n",
        "    *   The function now exclusively calculates:\n",
        "        *   **Distance to Municipality/Poblacion**: Using `osmnx.geocode_to_gdf()` to find municipality boundaries and `geopy.distance.geodesic` to calculate the geodesic distance to its centroid. Errors in geocoding specific municipality names sometimes resulted in `NaN` values.\n",
        "        *   **Distance to Major Paved Road**: Using `osmnx.graph.graph_from_point()` with a custom filter for major paved roads (`highway~\"primary|secondary|trunk|motorway\"` and `surface~\"paved\"`). `geopy.distance.geodesic` approximates the distance to the closest segment by checking its endpoints.\n",
        "        *   **Distance to Minor Paved Road**: Similar to major roads, but with a filter for minor paved roads (`highway~\"tertiary|residential|unclassified|service|living_street\"` and `surface~\"paved\"`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Application to Sampled Data**: The refined `get_geospatial_info` function was applied to the `sampled_location_df`, successfully populating the `distance_to_municipality_km`, `distance_to_major_paved_road_km`, and `distance_to_minor_paved_road_km` columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Review and Assessment**: The sampled results indicated that while municipality distances were calculated for some entries, a high number of `NaN`s appeared, especially for road distances. This suggests that the OSM data coverage for paved roads might be sparse in certain sampled areas, or that the `osmnx` queries did not yield results within the specified search radius for some points. The approximation method for road distances using segment endpoints was used due to `osmnx` function limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Scaling Considerations**: It was determined that applying the current function directly to the full 45,000+ row dataset would be highly inefficient due to numerous network requests. Strategies for optimization, such as caching, parallel processing, and querying larger geographical areas for road networks before local processing, were discussed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Detailed documentation explaining the precise methodology for calculating each distance, including specific OpenStreetMap tags, query parameters, and criteria for 'N/A' values, has been provided in the dedicated markdown blocks preceding this summary. This documentation transparently outlines the geodesic distance calculation for municipality centroids and the approximated geodesic distance to road segments.\n",

After modification, redefine the `get_geospatial_info` function and re-apply it to the 100-observation `sampled_location_df` to update the road distance columns. Finally, recalculate and display the proportion of NaN values for `distance_to_major_paved_road_km` and `distance_to_minor_paved_road_km` to evaluate the impact of this change.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the detailed plan:\n",
        "1.  **Redefine `get_geospatial_info` function**: Modify the `get_nearest_road_distance` helper function. The `custom_filter` will be updated to *remove* the `[surface~\"paved\"]` criterion.\n",
        "2.  **Re-apply Function to Sampled Data**: Re-run the corrected `get_geospatial_info` function on the `sampled_location_df` (now 100 observations, from earlier in the notebook, so I will re-sample 100 observations to make sure it's consistent with the previous task before I modify the function and re-run.) to populate the road distance columns with the new, less restrictive road criteria.\n",
        "3.  **Re-evaluate NaN Proportions**: Recalculate and display the proportion of NaN values for `distance_to_major_paved_road_km` and `distance_to_minor_paved_road_km`.\n",
        "4.  **Document Methodology and Distance Type**: Provide detailed documentation explaining the precise methodology for calculating each distance, explicitly stating that geodesic distance is used for road segments and outlining the specific OpenStreetMap tags and query parameters used for roads (now without the 'paved' filter) and the search radius.\n",
        "5.  **Review Sample Results**: Examine the results from the 100-observation sampled DataFrame, including the new distance columns.\n",
        "6.  **Discuss Scaling Up and Optimizations**: Discuss the strategy for applying the function to the full `location_df` and consider potential optimizations for performance.\n",
        "7.  **Final Task**: Display the updated sampled `location_df` showing all new distance columns. Provide a comprehensive summary of the findings and confirm that the documentation on methodology and distance types is transparently included."
